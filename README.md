# U2rUs-Teri-Chatbot
Chatbot developed as part of the 2023 Women Who Code Hackathon

Teri, the U2rUs chatbot, is a virtual assistant that helps people with uteruses better understand their reproductive health, prepare them for doctor's visits, and empower themselves with the knowledge they need to understand their reproductive health.
